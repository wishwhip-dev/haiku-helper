# Home screen and offline

This app can be put on a phone's home screen with its own icon and name, opens full screen from
there, and opens without a connection after one visit. All of it is already in place; there is
nothing to call and nothing to add.

## What ships

- `public/sw.js`: the offline copy. It keeps the home page and every file it loads, serves pages
  from the network first and from the copy when there is no connection, and never keeps an error
  page, a redirect or anything from another site.
- `components/home-screen.tsx`: `<HomeScreen />`, mounted in `app/providers.tsx`. It registers the
  copy in a built app (never in development or on localhost) and renders the card below.
- `components/install-card.tsx`: a one-time card on phones, in the app's own colours. On an iPhone
  or iPad in Safari it shows the three Share-menu steps; on Android it offers the browser's own
  install dialog from a button labelled "Install". The label is deliberate: the check presses the
  first button whose label starts with "Add", "New" or "Create" as the app's main action, so no
  button of the card may start that way. It shows once per browser and never when the app is
  already on the home screen.
- `lib/home-screen.ts`: the decisions behind the card, and `isStandalone(window)`, which says
  whether the app is running from the home screen.
- `app/manifest.ts`, `app/identity.ts` and the icons: the name under the icon is
  `homeScreenName`, which follows `identity.name`.

## Rules

- **Do not edit, move or remove these files**, and keep `<HomeScreen />` in `app/providers.tsx`.
- **Do not add another service worker, manifest or install prompt**: no `next-pwa`, Serwist or
  Workbox, no second `sw.js`, no install button of your own, and no `navigator.serviceWorker`
  call anywhere else.
- **Keep `id`, `start_url`, `scope` and `display` in `app/manifest.ts` as they are.** The name,
  description and colours there come from `app/identity.ts` and `app/icon-art.tsx`; change them
  there. If you change `--background` in `app/globals.css`, change `PAGE` in `app/icon-art.tsx`
  to the same value: it is the launch screen's colour.
- **Do not set `Cache-Control: no-store`** on pages or add headers to `/sw.js`.

## Writing pages that work offline

- The home page renders from what is stored on the device, never from a request made on load.
- Anything that needs the internet (the AI helper, a third-party API, moving data to another
  device) shows its own "You're offline" message instead of failing. `askModel` already returns
  `offline`.
- Anything fixed to the bottom of the screen takes `pb-safe` (and the top `pt-safe`), so it clears
  a phone's home indicator and notch. Use `min-h-dvh`, not `h-screen`.
- `isStandalone(window)` may hide something that only makes sense in a browser tab. Read it after
  the page mounts, never during render.

The app cannot send notifications or reminders while it is closed: never promise them.
